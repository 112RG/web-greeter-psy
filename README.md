# Web greeter psy theme

Should you use this no. Can you use this yes

Uses as https://codepen.io/vcomics/pen/djqNrm as the background and a https://github.com/GabrielTenma/lightdm-gab-gradient as the base

To install clone to /use/share/web-greeter/themes then install web-greeter and select psy as the theme. The default shell select is i3. I may or may not add a selector in the future. The theme is kinda jank but it does what I want it todo customize to your own liking
